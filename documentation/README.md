## This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project.
# Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff
# how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project.
# Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you
# with questions regarding your project after its submission.
# Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions
# that you think we might have while testing your work.

To interact with the website

        If you are simply looking around, feel free to browse postings on the main page.

        Go to the about page to reread most of this.

        If you find a posting near you that you want to get involved with, simply click
        on the register button, create a new account, and now you can return to that post
        and send a message directly to the poster-in-need.

    Feel free to create accounts, postings, send messages, etc.. (thats actually all there is to it :)  )

    I did not get around to implementing any time of point/ranking system
