## This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project.
# Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff
# how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project.
# Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you
# with questions regarding your project after its submission.
# Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions
# that you think we might have while testing your work.

To interact with the website

        If you are simply looking around, feel free to browse postings on the main page.

        Go to the about page to reread most of this.

        If you find a posting near you that you want to get involved with, simply click
        on the register button, create a new account, and now you can return to that post
        and send a message directly to the poster-in-need.

        I didn't generate a lot of data on the new PostgreSQL database, so the map is a bit sparse

    Feel free to create accounts, postings, send messages, etc.. (thats actually all there is to it :)  )


        To run it locally, line 30 & 36 in application.py need to be uncommented.
        And any use of "https://neighborhood-helper.herokuapp.com/" needs to be
        replaced with your webaddress for all of the links to work.
        Also, when running it locally, the Maps won't work since they are restricted to
        "https://neighborhood-helper.herokuapp.com/*"

        If need be I can remove all restrictions from the API temporarily.


    I did not get around to implementing any time of point/ranking system, which would of been a part of
    the "best" outcome

    I think this README is really short because there just are not that many instructions :)
